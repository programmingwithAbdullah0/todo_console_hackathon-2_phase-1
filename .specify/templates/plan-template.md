# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, SQLModel, UV, OpenAI Agents SDK, Better Auth
**Storage**: Neon PostgreSQL
**Testing**: pytest, Playwright, k6
**Target Platform**: Linux (Docker) -> Kubernetes (Minikube/Cloud)
**Project Type**: Web Application (Next.js + FastAPI)
**Performance Goals**: API < 200ms p95, DB < 100ms
**Constraints**: No manual coding, No localStorage (Phase III+), JWT Auth
**Scale/Scope**: 100+ concurrent users (Phase V)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] Spec-First: Does this feature follow the SDD pipeline?
- [ ] Stateless: Are we avoiding localStorage/sessionStorage? (Phase III+)
- [ ] Security: Is every query filtered by `user_id`?
- [ ] Headers: Does every file include required metadata?
- [ ] Tech Stack: Does it match Python 3.13+/Next.js 16+?
- [ ] Phase Alignment: Does the implementation respect current Phase constraints?

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
